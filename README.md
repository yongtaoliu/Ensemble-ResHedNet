# Ensemble-ResHedNet

This is a github repository demonstrating ensemble ResHedNet training associated with paper "Exploring Physics of Ferroelectric Domain Walls in Real Time: Deep Learning Enabled Scanning Probe Microscopy" [https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.11457]

The Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the ensemble-ResHedNet method. 

The video shows a PFM measurement, where the ResHedNet converts the PFM domain image to ferroelastic wall image in the real-time.
